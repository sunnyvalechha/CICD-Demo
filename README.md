How Build and Deployment Process works before CICD pipeline of Jenkins?

Step 1: One or multiple Developement team start planning and working on application.
Step 2: They push their code to Central repository (Github)
Step 3: After all the peices of code pushed into github we will Build the code, as the code is raw code and not in usable format that means we have to create the .exe of code.
Step 4: Test the code, when the build is created we will test the code if the build code is working fine.
Step 5: Deploy, Deploy application to server

Above all step done manually and might get error in any stage so the developers have to follow all process again.

Challenges of manual work:
1. Dev write new code every day and follow the same process every day.
2. Multiple environment can be there like Test and Prod.
3. Time consuming
4. Error prone

**Now, Entry of DevOps**

Development + Operations 

Dev: Project development team
Ops: Build & Deploy team
